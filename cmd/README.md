<!-- before staring any project we have to initialize go module -->
`
go mod init github.com/username/students-api
`

<!-- to run -->
`
go run cmd/students-api/main.go
`

<!-- initialize git repos -->
`
git init
`
and then stage all the files and then commit


<!-- after adding config file first stage change and then again commit -->

`
go to vs code github extension and click on +icon to stage and then write message add config file 
and then commit
`
commit each steps this is the good practice



<!-- install the below package -->
go get -u github.com/ilyakaznacheev/cleanenv
